**Install requirements**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Run functional implementation**

`python implementations/functional.py`

Follow console I/O instructions. You should get full path to the treasure after all inputs.

**Object oriented implementation**

There is no console I/O script for OO implementation but you could see and try pytest unit tests.
